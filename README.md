        sku
        tracked
        inventoryLevels(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              location {
                name
              }
              available
            }
          }
        }
      }

              inventoryItem {
                id
                inventoryLevels(first: 5) {
                  edges {
                    node {
                      available
                      location {

                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Detail Page

GraphQL Mutation for Stock Update:
